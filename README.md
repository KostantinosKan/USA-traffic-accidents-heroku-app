# Exploratory Data Analysis of A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020)
In this project I will investigate the traffic accidents that happened in U.S.A between the years 2016-2020. By performing an Exploratory Data Analysis I will try to understand the causality that leads to an accident and attempt to answer questions like When, Where, and Why accidents tend to happen.

## Code and Resources Used
**Python version:** 3.10.2<br/>
**Packages:** JupyterDash, GeoPandas, Folium, Plotly, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.<br/>

### Building the Interactive Dashboard
* Create plotly graphs using the graph_object library.
* Create choropleth map using the folium library.
* Create an Indicator of the total number of accidents.
* Integrate all the above in a Dash application.
